README FILE

The code to perform my interpolation is called proj_3sk3_v2.m

The code to perform matlabs built-in interpolation is called matlab.m



The code to calculate mean square error is called mse.m

To use either of these program files, all images included in this folder must be uploaded to matlab.

Located at the top of proj_3sk3_v2.m is the strings inputfilename and outputfilename.

set inputfilename = your-file-name

ex: inputfilename='img_example_lr.png';

set outputfilename = new-file-name

ex: outputfilename='pepper_interpolated.png';


The matlab.m and mse.m program files have similar variables at the top for naming input/output files,
use them in the same way.

NOTE mse.m has a name for the matlab-bicubic output image, the proj_3sk3_v2.m output, and the original high resolution image.

NOTE matlab.m and proj_3sk3_v2.m must be run before mse.m for it to work.
